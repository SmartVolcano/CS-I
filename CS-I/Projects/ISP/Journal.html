    <h2>Development Engineer</h2>
   <h3>Development engineers consider the goals of the team to design the product. I hope to help my team with ideas for our project. I also hope to learn enough swift to be helpful.</h3>
    <p></p>
      
    <h2>QA Engineer</h2>
    <h3>QA engineers are tasked with debugging the product before launch. I often miss things so I might not be the best for this job. However, if I want to do this I'll have to be more careful.</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Project Engineer</h2>
    <h3>A Project Engineer uses engineering skills to aid the team. I do not have much experience in Swift yet. However, I expect to get better with time.</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Product Manager</h2>
    <h3>A project manager controls other aspects such as meeting times to work on the project. I can be forgetful sometimes so I might not be the best for this role either. However, I hate letting others down so I will find ways to remember.</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Release Engineer</h2>
    <h3>A release engineer makes sure everything is completed and delivers the final product. Once I get better with Swift I am sure that I will be able to aid with this job. A release engineer seems only important at the end though.</h3>
