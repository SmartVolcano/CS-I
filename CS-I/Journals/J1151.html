    <h2>1.1:</h2>
   <h3>How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?</h3>
    <p>Branching allows for more possible actions after a condition.<p>
      
    <h2>1.2:</h2>
   <h3>Why do you think the term consequent is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the Boolean test evaluates to true?</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h2>2.1:</h2>
   <h3>Why is the first Jump instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not?</h3>
    <p>The jump is conditional because the alternative is first. If alternative is false then jump will be executed.</p>

    <h2>2.2:</h2>
   <h3>What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?</h3>
    <p>It will print the consequent message.</p>
      
    <h2>2.3:</h2>
    <h3>Why is there no need for a corresponding Jump instruction after the alternative?</h3>
    <p>It will always move down to the next one.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>To map out a plan of the code.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>Understanding the assembly</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I think the experience was good.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I can now make flow charts.</p>
