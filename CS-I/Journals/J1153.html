    <h2>1.1:</h2>
   <h3>Compare this behavior to that of the while loop. What are the similarities? What are the differences?</h3>
    <p>They both use the while loop but the repeat loop only repeats when while is true.<p>
      
    <h2>2.1:</h2>
    <h3>What are the minimum number of times that this loop will execute?</h3>
    <p>1</p>

    <h2>3.1:</h2>
   <h3>What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?</h3>
    <p>It loops the program back to the statment.</p>

    <h2>4.1:</h2>
   <h3>Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a while loop using a repeat-while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can change the conditional variable's value.</p>
      
    <h2>5.1:</h2>
    <h3>Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a repeat-while loop using a while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.</h3>
    <p>Yes, the same way as the answer above.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to use repeat-while loops and what they are for.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I had trouble understanding when to use the different loops.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I think more examples could have been given.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I can now do the basics.</p>
