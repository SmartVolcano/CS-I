    <h2>1.1:</h2>
   <h3>Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model.</h3>
    <p>One service I use with the client/server model is Canvas. Another of the services I use is Google Drive.<p>
      
    <h2>2.1:</h2>
   <h3>It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h3>
    <p>I think it is important that two different users can use directories of the same name so if multiple people shared a computer they could still have their stuff seperate.</p>

    <h2>3.1:</h2>
   <h3>Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</h3>
    <p>I think that the home directory has a special symbol because it is the main directory.</p>

    <h2>4.1:</h2>
   <h3>Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h3>
    <p>The prompt changed and it is useful because it shows what directory we are in.</p>
      
    <h2>5.1:</h2>
    <h3>What happens each time you press the up arrow key?</h3>
    <p>When up arrow key is pressed old commands will show up</p>

    <h2>5.2:</h2>
    <h3>What happens each time you press the down arrow key?</h3>
    <p>When down arrow key is pressed it goes back to the newer commands.</p>

    <h2>6.1:</h2>
    <h3>Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
    <p>I think the text went into out.txt.</p>

    <h2>7.1:</h2>
    <h3>How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h3>
    <p>The ls command shows what is in the current directory and the tree command shows what is in all directories.</p>

    <h2>7.2:</h2>
    <h3>How do you choose to use one over the other?</h3>
    <p>I will use tree when I am trying to find things and ls when checking for certain files within a directory.</p>

    <h2>8.1:</h2>
    <h3>What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h3>
    <p>I think it specifies do nothing.</p>

    <h2>8.2:</h2>
    <h3>Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h3>
    <p>Yes, by putting in the command.</p>
      
    <h2>9.1:</h2>
    <h3>How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h3>
    <p>A number popped up and I could still type commands.</p>

    <h2>9.2:</h2>
    <h3>What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h3>
    <p>You can still do things while another command is happening.</p>

    <h2>9.3:</h2>
    <h3>What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?</h3>
    <p>I think it might be an id for the job.</p>

    <h2>10.1:</h2>
    <h3>What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h3>
    <p>I see a list when I execute the jobs command.</p>

    <h2>10.2:</h2>
    <h3>How do you explain your observations?</h3>
    <p>They are the sleep commands I put in.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned various commands and what they did.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>It was difficult to understand what the jobs are.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I think the experience was good.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I have memorized many commands and I can now do the basics.</p>
