    <h2>1.1:</h2>
   <h3>What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h3>
    <p>I recognize the AND truth table for the output of the Carry column.<p>
      
    <h2>1.2:</h2>
   <h3>What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h3>
    <p>I recognize the XOR truth table for the output of the Sum column.</p>

    <h2>2.1:</h2>
   <h3>What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h3>
    <p>All the outputs are the opposite except for the carry out when a and b are equal.</p>

    <h2>2.2:</h2>
   <h3>Why is this true?</h3>
    <p>It is true because the carry in adds one.</p>
      
    <h2>3.1:</h2>
    <h3>Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h3>
    <p>It does not have a carry in.</p>

    <h2>3.2:</h2>
    <h3>Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>Yes, because they happen in order.</p>

    <h2>3.3:</h2>
    <h3>Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h3>
    <p>We can infer that it is higher than the amount a 16 bit integer can be. It is called the 16 bit integer limit.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>The big idea is to do addition with binary in electronics.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>A challenge was figuring out how to make the full adder.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I think the experience was good.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I have trained more on making gates based on a truth table.</p>
