    <h2>1.1:</h2>
   <h3>Why is the test executed before the loop?</h3>
    <p>To let the program know what it is going to do.<p>
      
    <h2>1.2:</h2>
    <h3>Compare this diagram to that of the conditional. What are the similarities? What are the differences?</h3>
    <p>They both go different ways but this one ends the same but not the conditional.</p>

    <h2>1.3:</h2>
   <h3>What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?</h3>
    <p>Its purpose is to go to the next part.</p>
